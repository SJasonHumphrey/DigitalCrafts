It is said the album received its name from the band members' attitudes that life should be lived as if only one day remains.

It will be released by Roadrunner Records worldwide except in the United States, where it will be self-released on October 8, 2013, through EMI. The lead single, \"Addicted to Pain\", was released on August 12, 2013. Fortress was recorded between April 26 and July 2, 2013 at Studio Barbarosa in Orlando, Florida. The album was written over the three previous years while the band toured, as well as during Alter Bridge's hiatus due to singer Myles Kennedy touring with Slash, guitarist Mark Tremonti releasing his debut solo album All I Was, and drummer Scott Phillips recording with his band Projected. Later in the month, Tremonti announced the band had approved the cover art and had mastered the new album.\n\nIn July, in an interview with MusicRadar.com Tremonti revealed that he would sing lead vocals on one track called \"The Waters Rise\", which appears on the album as \"Waters Rising\". The official track listing and cover art for Fortress was revealed on July 31, 2013 along with the track listing, consisting of 12 songs. The artwork was designed by Dan Tremonti.\n\nOn August 4, the cover art for the lead single \"Addicted to Pain\" was revealed, and a day later the band confirmed that the lead single \"Addicted to Pain\" would be released on August 12, in Europe, and on August 20, in the US. The single was made available for streaming a few days before release. On September 5, the official video for \"Addicted to Pain\" was released. The official video was shot by award-winning director Dan Catullo. On September 23, the band streamed the album in its entirety for a limited time on the Metal Hammer website as a UK exclusive.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"intLoved":null,"intScore":"8.5","intScoreVotes":"2","strReview":"","strMood":"","strTheme":"","strSpeed":"Medium","strLocation":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"d49ad853-5ca1-4cbb-a6b9-90f358239829","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"60a23fda-a440-4ab9-a344-7dfdd2ed341a","strAllMusicID":"mw0002569317","strBBCReviewID":null,"strRateYourMusicID":null,"strDiscogsID":"604216","strWikidataID":"Q14404733","strWikipediaID":"Fortress_(Alter_Bridge_album)","strGeniusID":null,"strLyricWikiID":null,"strMusicMozID":null,"strItunesID":null,"strAmazonID":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idAlbum":"2269321","idArtist":"112557","idLabel":"44906","strAlbum":"The Last Hero","strAlbumStripped":"The Last Hero","strArtist":"Alter Bridge","strArtistStripped":"Alter Bridge","intYearReleased":"2016","strStyle":"Rock/Pop","strGenre":"Hard Rock","strLabel":"Napalm Records","strReleaseFormat":"Album","intSales":"0","strAlbumThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumb/rwpwuu1474776755.jpg","strAlbumThumbHQ":null,"strAlbumThumbBack":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/thumbback/1jk6we1620331244.jpg","strAlbumCDart":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/cdart/e1oxb71599375294.png","strAlbumSpine":null,"strAlbum3DCase":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/3dcase/ctfecn1599375308.png","strAlbum3DFlat":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/3dflat/g89cxb1599375323.png","strAlbum3DFace":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/3dface/r8zg3k1599375316.png","strAlbum3DThumb":"https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/album/3dthumb/bts1451599375664.png","strDescriptionEN":"The Last Hero is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Alter Bridge, released on October 7, 2016, by Napalm Records worldwide except in North America, where it was released on the band's own vanity label.

If the band\u2019s last studio album, 2016\u2019s \u2018The Last Hero\u2019, tipped closer to Hard Rock, their refreshing new opus \u2018Walk The Sky\u2019 walks a finer tightrope, balanced precariously between a rock and the bands heavier side. If some would have delighted in another fourteen song album of more quintessential Alter Bridge, others yearned for a stirring of the pot. Well, with \u2018Walk The Sky\u2019, their sixth studio effort, the pot does indeed get stirred, producing some thrilling results.\nAlthough you wouldn\u2019t have guessed it based on the record\u2019s leading singles. \u201cWouldn\u2019t You Rather\u201d, with its spitfire delivery and heavy instrumentation, so dense it\u2019s almost impenetrable, made for a curious first offering by suggesting an entirely heavier direction. Indeed, the semi symphonic metal \u201cPay No Mind,\u201d and the crushing \u201cTake The Crown,\u201d would also suggest Alter Bridge have simply swung to the other side of the pendulum, gearing up to deliver a heavier \u2018The Last Hero.\u2019 That is until in the brilliant, epic, and stunning anthem that is \u201cGodspeed\u201d.\n To critique \u201cGodspeed\u201d with anything other than unconditional commendation would be inexcusable. From its initial, imminently addictive opening piano/synth hook, to its explosive main riff and emotive verses, by the time Myles Kennedy delivers the ascending pre-chorus before launching you into a chorus too good not to adore, \u201cGodspeed\u201d has comfortably established itself as the albums best track. In fact, it holds its own among the bands best across their entire catalog. It is simply that good.\n  If suspicions were beginning to brew that Alter Bridge had become a formulaic outfit, these speculations meet their end with this synth-based, modern rock classic that explores some new and exciting heavier territories for the band. Ambitious, adventurous and unmistakably alive, \u2018Walk The Sky\u2019 might well redefine what quintessential Alter Bridge sounds like.\nReviewed by Carl O'Rourke for metalwani.com.","strMood":"","strTheme":"","strSpeed":"Medium","strLocation":null,"strMusicBrainzID":"2d0bf0b1-b1c9-4163-ae4e-830d2395aaf9","strMusicBrainzArtistID":"60a23fda-a440-4ab9-a344-7dfdd2ed341a","strAllMusicID":null,"strBBCReviewID":null,"strRateYourMusicID":null,"strDiscogsID":null,"strWikidataID":null,"strWikipediaID":null,"strGeniusID":null,"strLyricWikiID":null,"strMusicMozID":null,"strItunesID":null,"strAmazonID":null,"strLocked":"unlocked"}]}
